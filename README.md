# Design

This repository contains Low Level Design (LLD) solutions for different problem statements.

Below are the problem statements. These will be updated as and when I code the solution.

1. Design a parking lot system where you need to provide a token with the parking space number on it to each new entry for the space closest to the entrance. When someone leave you need update this space as empty. What data structures will you use to perform the closest empty space tracking, plus finding what all spaces are occupied at a give time.
2. Design a locker (like the one found in Amaozn Hub) where you can store the packages and pickup the package. Returning the package is an extension of this and can be easily implemented by validating the user and package details. There will be three types of lockers (small, medium, large) and the packages have to be stored in the respective locker sizes.
